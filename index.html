                <br />This was the period when India experienced a consumer boom, which
                continues to this day. During this time, international brands and multinational corporations such as
                Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, and various apparel and product brands entered the Indian market.
                Their marketing efforts and products had a significant impact on consumer preferences, which kept
                evolving and continues to.

            Glocalization, the combination of globalization and localization, is a concept that
            describes the adaptation of global products and services to suit local tastes, culture, and preferences.<br /><br />Glocalization
            played a significant role in the rise of consumerism in India by blending global and local elements in
            products, services, and marketing strategies. This approach catered to the diverse and culturally rich
            Indian market.

                  while a high CPI value signifies inflation, not all inflation is necessarily harmful. Moderate
                  inflation is often considered a sign of a healthy economy, as it can encourage spending and
                  investment. However, very high or hyperinflation can be detrimental, causing economic instability and
                  hardships for consumers.
